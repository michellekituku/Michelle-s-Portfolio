## 🧠 NLP Projects
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|----------------------|-----------|
| 🌾 [PSA Translation — English→Swahili](https://github.com/michellekituku/PSA-Translation) | NLP | Built a MarianMT pipeline to translate agricultural PSAs to Swahili; fine-tuned on domain data. BLEU ≈ 61. | `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`, `seaborn` |
|🔡 [Exploring Language Modeling with N-Gram Sizes & Smoothing](https://github.com/michellekituku/NGram-Language-Modeling) | NLP | Implemented n-gram language models (unigram, bigram) with Laplace, Good-Turing, and Kneser-Ney smoothing. Evaluated using cross-validation and perplexity. Visualized performance trade-offs across methods. | `nltk`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |

## 🤖 Machine Learning
| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|----------------------|-----------|
| 🩺 [Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/michellekituku/Breast-Cancer-LogReg) | Classification | Built a logistic regression classifier on the Breast Cancer dataset. Compared effects of regularization (C) on accuracy and coefficients. Achieved >95% test accuracy. Visualized coefficient importance across features. | `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| 🏦 [Loan Approval Prediction](https://github.com/michellekituku/Loan-Approval-Prediction) | Classification | Built a classification model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details. Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with accuracy & ROC-AUC metrics. | `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
